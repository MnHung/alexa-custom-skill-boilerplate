~A boilerplate for develop custom skill and deploy it using Serverless framework and ask-cli~

I was ment to create a boilerplate which can help us easily develop and deploy *custom skill* with its *Lambda function*. I've already dealed with Lambda with Serverless framework. When I was looking for a way to deploy skill, I happily found [ask-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ask-cli). and then... I give up this boilerplate because ask-cli is too powerful. It covers **all** skill details, much more than what I wanted to cover: intent schema, sample utterances and custom slot types, it also cover very detailed thing such as invocation name, skill id, endpoint, skill desciptions, even the skill icon path. It *already* prepare a boilerplate.
